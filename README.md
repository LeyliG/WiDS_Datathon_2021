"The WiDS Datathon 2021 focuses on patient health, with an emphasis on the chronic condition of diabetes, through data from MIT’s GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) initiative. Brought to you by the WiDS Worldwide team at Stanford, the West Big Data Innovation Hub, and the WiDS Datathon Committee, this year’s datathon is open until March 1, 2021. Winners will be announced at the WiDS Conference via livestream, reaching a community of 100,000+ data enthusiasts across more than 85 countries.


Background:

Getting a rapid understanding of the context of a patient’s overall health has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare workers around the world struggle with hospitals overloaded by patients in critical condition. Intensive Care Units (ICUs) often lack verified medical histories for incoming patients. A patient in distress or a patient who is brought in confused or unresponsive may not be able to provide information about chronic conditions such as heart disease, injuries, or diabetes. Medical records may take days to transfer, especially for a patient from another medical provider or system.

Knowledge about chronic conditions such as diabetes can inform clinical decisions about patient care and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Learn more about the global scale of diabetes on our Datathon News page, and make sure you are subscribed to the WiDS Datathon Mailing List to receive the latest updates, tutorials, and articles.


Overview:

This year's challenge will focus on models to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus. Using data from the first 24 hours of intensive care, individuals and teams will explore labeled training data for model development. Participants will then upload predictions for unlabeled data to Kaggle and these predictions will be used to determine the public leaderboard rankings, as well as the final leaderboard revealed at the close of the competition."
